# TEK_WS

This repository includes articles from a traditional knowledge-western science literature review and text analysis.

The literature review's objectives are to:
1. To educate ourselves about discourses around Traditional Knowledge, including arguments for and issues/concerns about interweaving Traditional Knowledge with Western science
2. To compile case studies and synthesize best practices that can inform Tribal-non-Tribal partnerships in Bay-Delta restoration and management activities.
3. To compile case studies of governance models associated with interweaving Traditional Knowledge and Western science.
4. To summarize/synthesize select literature as background for a larger assessment.
5. To build a resource that can support ongoing dialogue with internal leadership, Council members, and external (Tribal and non-Tribal) partners.

This repository is in development (for more information: Pascale.Goertler@deltacouncil.ca.gov).
